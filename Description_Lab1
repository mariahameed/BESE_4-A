2)	About.html
3)	Home.html
4)	Contact.html
5)	Gallery.html

Image file:
It’s just an image inserted in the gallery.html page
 


Before I explain the remaining files let me explain the code that is common in all files:

Code	explanation
<!DOCTYPE html>                                                    
    
   defines that the document is of type HTML

    <html lang="en">
     
        <head>

header of document starts here

            <meta charset="utf-8">

            <title>Lab_Task # 1</title> 
it sets the title of the page



            <!--[if lt IE 9]>
                <script src="dist/html5shiv.js"></script>
            <![endif]-->


<style>
Here starts the css part

Now we are going to style ul
	ul {
		list-style-type: none;
Remove the default style


Set the margin to zero
		margin: 0;

Set padding to 0
		padding: 0;
Only data part that fits will be shown. There will be no scroll

		overflow: hidden;
	}


Now we are going to style li
We just set it to float right. Every new entry will be added to the left of the already present list

	li {
		float: right;
	}






	a:link, a:visited {
Now we are going to style <a> when the link is visited or when nothing happen to link:


		display: block;
It’s display is block so within a single element e.g: “li” only a single a will appear on a line


		width: 120px;
Width will be 120px

		font-weight: bold;
Font will be bold

		color: #FFFFFF;
Font Color will be white

		background-color: #567675;
background Color will be  

		text-align: center;

		padding: 8px;
there will be a gap of 8px between text and <a> borders on all sides

		text-decoration: none;
default <a> text decoration is removed

		text-transform: uppercase;
all the text will be in capital letters

	}

Now we are going to style <a> when we hover over the link or when the link is active:
	a:hover, a:active {


		background-color: #999888;
Color will be:  

	}

		</div>
	</div>
		






Home.html
I had to use table so I decided to It in this way :
Here is what I made:
 

You will be able to understand the whole logic by looking at this:
 

So here you can see that I have added a table with 2 rows and 5 columns, 3 columns filled in upper row and 2 filled in lower row. 

If I explain complete code here in the same order in which it is written in the file, it may become a little bit confusing, so I am going to divide it in parts and describe only unique parts of code

	
<table>
Add table

    <tr>
Add a row to table

        <td>
Add a cell to the row

        </td>
Closes the cell

    </tr>
Closes the row

<table>
Closes the table	
Now each cell has following code added:

Code	explanation
<td 
Adds a cell

style="padding-left:6px ; 
Sets left padding as 6px 

padding-right:6px;">
Sets right padding as 6px


<div 
Adds a div

style="padding:60px; 
border-radius:50%; 
Sets the radius. This changes the corners to circular

background-color:#084B8A;">
<h2> 
<a> about </a> 
</h2>
Adds a heading to div

</div>
</td>
Cell ends here
